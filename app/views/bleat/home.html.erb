  <h2 class="poem-title">By the Hoof of the Wild Goat
  <span class="author">Rudyard Kipling</span></h2>

  <p>By the Hoof of the Wild Goat uptossed<br>
  From the cliff where she lay in the Sun<br>
  Fell the Stone<br>
  To the Tarn where the daylight is lost,<br>
  So she fell from the light of the Sun<br>
  And alone!</p>

  <p>Now the fall was ordained from the first<br>
  With the Goat and the Cliff and the Tarn,<br>
  But the Stone<br>
  Knows only her life is accursed<br>
  As she sinks from the light of the Sun<br>
  And alone!</p>

  <p>Oh Thou Who hast builded the World,<br>
  Oh Thou Who hast lighted the Sun,<br>
  Oh Thou Who hast darkened the Tarn,<br>
  Judge Thou<br>
  The sin of the Stone that was hurled<br>
  By the goat from the light of the Sun,<br>
  As she sinks in the mire of the Tarn,<br>
  Even now--even now--even now!</p>
